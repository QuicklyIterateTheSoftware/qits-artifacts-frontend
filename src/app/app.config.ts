/**
 * Three providers, in the order spa-home documents and spa-ci and spa-cd repeat.
 *
 * - `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners` funnels genuinely-global errors and unhandled rejections
 *   into Angular's `ErrorHandler`.
 * - `provideRouter` carries the whole of this app's state — every level of the drill-down is a path
 *   segment — so it is what makes each page bookmarkable.
 * - `withFetch` is not a preference. The default XHR backend is invisible to OTLP fetch
 *   instrumentation, so choosing it would quietly forfeit client spans the moment this deployment
 *   grows a telemetry relay. Every call this app makes is a same-origin path behind the gateway,
 *   and these reads carry no credential at all — the artifacts token filter covers writes only.
